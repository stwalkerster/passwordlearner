== Password Learning tool ==

This is a tool to help you learn a new password on a char-by-char basis.

Enter your new (currently has to be 14-char) password in the top box as a paste from something like KeePass,
and then proceed to attempt to enter it in the bottom box. Pressing return at the end will clear the boxes if you have it correct.

When you can finally remember it, congrats!
